# What does content management mean?

What is a content in sensenet content management system?
In sensenet everything is content. Documents, tasks, users, projects, even system configuration files – everything – are stored and managed in the content repository [link]. It is the foundation that makes content management easy and powerful at the same time. All content items are organized in a content tree [link], so you can always think in subtrees and inheritance when managing and presenting content.

# Anybody can do anything?
Content management is a collaborative process and every user has his own part in it. At this point we can talk about roles and permissions. [role based permission, document level permission], so basically what the user can or cannot do with the certain content.
There is a set of basic built-in permissions, such as See, Open, Save, Delete etc., and it is even possible to add custom ones as well.
The tree based hierarchical content structure in sensenet ensures permission inheritance, so it is enough to set a permission rule one time and it comes down in lower levels of the tree. This means, if you set a permission on a document library it will be automatically applied to subfolders and contents.
•	Creator – responsible for creating and editing content.
•	Editor – responsible for tuning the content message and the style of delivery, including translation and localization.
•	Publisher – responsible for releasing the content for use.
•	Administrator – responsible for managing access permissions to folders, collections and files, usually accomplished by assigning access rights to user groups or roles. Admins may also assist and support users in various ways.
•	Consumer, viewer or guest – the person who reads or otherwise takes in content after it is published or shared.
