# Simple approval

Simple approval adds an extra step to the default publishing process. When approval is turned on, contents needs to be sent for approval and can only be published when the review is finished and modification requests has been adapted (if applicable). 

# Indicating roles and permissions

It is important to differentiate roles like editor, approver and so on. Approval feature works best if permissions are defined correctly and the whole process is tailor made to the business logic.

# steps
[possible illustration of the steps could be something like that](https://images.ctfassets.net/fo9twyrwpveg/1EQtohKijakksU2KwS262w/69c5b114908eba58787c29ce1d1ad737/Step_11.png?fm=jpg&fl=progressive&q=90&w=2156)

First a draft is born which will be sent for review. The reviewer (or approver) can approve the document as it is or propose changes. In this case the draft is modified and resubmitted. When everyone is happy with the result, the document gets approved and published.

# Automatic notifications on state change

It is possible to enable notifications for every state change of a specific document. When this feature is turned on, the sytsem notifies all subscribed users ??????via email????? when the content has been changed. Such actions could be edit, new version [link to versioning], approval and many more. 


# Usage (use cases)

Could be useful when users with different permission roles are working on a document, and the content creator (editor) does not have publishing right. In this scenario it is the approver who will review (ask for modification) and pubslih the content at the end of the process.
