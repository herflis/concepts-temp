# collaboration
sensenet enables collaborative content management, thanks to office online editing.
Being able to collaborate on the same document contemporary saves you time of emailing files, saves storage also, and prevents you from having to reconcile multiple versions of the same document.

# How does it work
There is no special co-authoring mode and no command to begin co-authoring. You can edit the file as normally you do, and if others are editing the document also, Office will alert you of their presence.  You can open the document (word, excel, ppt) right in the browser and it saves automatically.

# Versioning
Versioning, also known as revision control, is the management of changes to documents and other information stored in a file system or repository.

The main goal of versioning is to prevent information from being overwritten or deleted during everyday work with documents. Changes are kept track of, and a mechanism is offered to restore a particular document to a previous version.
The versioning system of sensenet also provides mechanisms for keeping the published version of a document under heavy editing visible to outside users, while you continue to work on the latest, draft version. In sensenet, versioning is disabled by default.

# Permissions

# Under the hood
To be able to configure this feature on the admin ui you need to have office online server and client side subscription.
