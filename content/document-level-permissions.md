# Document level Permissions

# intro
sensenet offers you the ability to set permissions even on document level in addition to the role-based permission [link] logic.
advantage
Using content (or document) level permissions, you can set who has access to an individual content and allow/restrict actions one by one.

# built-in and custom permissions
There is a set of basic built-in permissions, such as See, Open, Save, Delete etc., and it is even possible to add custom ones as well.
•	See: you only have the information that the content exists (content metadata cannot be accessed)
•	Open: you have access to content metadata
•	Save: you can make changes in the content metadata
•	Other permissions for removing or approving a content or managing lists and workspaces.

# permission inheritance
One of the advantages of the tree based hierarchical content structure in sensenet, is that it ensures permission inheritance, so it is enough to set a permission rule one time and it comes down in lower levels of the tree. This means, if you set a permission on a document library it will be automatically applied to subfolders and contents.

# how to use
It is possible to manage content (document) level permission settings through the admin surface, or with User Management and Permission APIs.

# pro tip
Useful when you want to give access to a document only for specific users (and not by role).
