sensenet offers you the ability of setting permissions even on document level in addition to the [role-based permission](/concepts/role-based-permissions) logic.

# Advantages
Using content (or document) level permissions, you can set who has access to an individual content and allow/restrict actions one by one.

# Built-in and custom permissions

There is a set of basic built-in permissions, such as See, Open, Save, Delete etc., and it is even possible to add custom ones as well.
•	See: you only have the information that the content exists (content metadata cannot be accessed)
•	Open: you have access to content metadata
•	Save: you can make changes in the content metadata
•	Other permissions for removing or approving a content or managing lists and workspaces.
